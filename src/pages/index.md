  title: Why Grant Watson?
  description: If you have not guessed it, my name is Grant Watson and I am a
    freelance software engineer for hire. I love working with the web, its a
    frontier that allows for so much connection. This portal we call "online"
    allows for personal growth and professional growth in ANY field.
description: My dream is to change the way we expand on the web. From providing
  solutions that not everyone considers. I absolutely love my career as a
  developer.

        to start from the ground up and have something developed that you can

        As a business, you need to get online. Maybe you have a website right
        now, but it does not meet your expectations or desires. I work with most
        frameworks and technologies: Wordpress, ReactJS, C# and will love to
        work with you to design a beautiful website.

  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
